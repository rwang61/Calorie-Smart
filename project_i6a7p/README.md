# Calorie Smart - Ultimate Calorie Tracker

## What Will the Application Do?
The Calorie Tracker project aims to design and develop an application that enables users to track their daily calorie 
intake from food and output from various physical user. The application will provide a convenient platform for
users to record their meals and snacks, enter the corresponding calorie values, and track their overall calorie 
consumption. Additionally, it will allow users to log their physical user, estimate the calories burned, 
and maintain a balance between their calorie intake and output.

## Who will use it?
This application will be utilized by individuals who are conscious about their health and fitness goals, 
as well as those looking to manage their weight or improve their overall well-being. 
By offering an intuitive and user-friendly interface, the Calorie Tracker will empower users to monitor their 
nutritional habits and make informed decisions regarding their diet and physical activity. 
It will also serve as a valuable tool for individuals working with nutritionists or fitness professionals 
to track their progress and make necessary adjustments.

## Why is this project of interest to me?
This project is particularly interesting to me as it merges my passion for software development with my commitment to 
promoting a healthy lifestyle. By developing a Calorie Tracker, I aim to create a solution that not only assists users 
in managing their caloric intake and output effectively but also raises awareness about the significance of balanced
nutrition and regular exercise. Through this project, I anticipate enhancing my technical skills while contributing 
to the well-being and health consciousness of individuals striving for a healthier lifestyle.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a meal or exercise with calories to my daily user
- As a user, I want to be able to return my full user
- As a user, I want to be able to get the calorie balance from all the user I listed
- As a user, I want to be able to get the calories intake
- As a user, I want to be able to get the calories burnt
- As a user, I want to be able to save my calories tracked to file (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my calories tracked from file (if I so choose

## Instructions for  Grader
- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by first selecting which type of activity
  (meals or exercise) by clicking the calorie intake or calorie burnt radio button
- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by selecting the dropdown list(combobox)) to
select the activity
- You can generate the third required action by entering the calories for the activity into the textbox
- You can generate the fourth required action by clicking the add button, which will add your activity to the table
- You will be able to see the calorie balance (Intake - Burnt) beside the calorie balance label
- You can locate my visual component by running the program (SplashScreen)
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save all button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load activities button
- You can quit the application by selecting the quit button

All activities were saved to the file

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time to work on the project, I would enhance the maintainability and flexibility of 
the program by implementing a more streamlined approach to managing the LogEvent functionality. By introducing 
a global configuration mechanism, the codebase now allows for centralized control over logging behavior. This means 
that instead of making alterations across multiple instances within the program, logging can be enabled or disabled by 
simply modifying a single global variable.

The rationale behind this refactoring stems from the need to simplify future code modifications and minimize redundancy.
The global configuration approach not only enhances readability but also contributes to a more efficient development 
process. It promotes a more modular code structure, easing the burden of managing logging-related changes across various
code segments. This strategic refactoring aligns with the principle of optimizing code maintainability and 
adaptability, ultimately resulting in a more robust and scalable software solution.
